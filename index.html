        <h1>Tech and Code</h1>
            <p> Our project utilized the Adafruit octogonal board in order to set different lighting. The lighting in the story was used to represent toxicity and therefore
                the color grew more pronounced as time went. We used simple buttons to control the lights. Using Dragonframe, I took the shots of around half the frames and
                suggested various shots.

         <h1>Social Impact</h1>
            <p> Our project showed the evolution of media consumption. When we start off, the penguin has his newspaper that not only costs him to read, but he has to go out
                of his way to get it. Thanks to upgraded electronics, the penguin now has access to media wherever he wants. This gives rise to the influence of biased and 
                fake news sources. Naturally, the inability to accept ideals other than your own causes conflict and division between people and that's why a healthy balance
                of different sources and perspectives is necessary.
